   LEARN: Decoding with elm-json-extra

   `objectN` is convenient but it has a few issues. If you add or remove fields you have to change things in a few different places now.

   There is a third party library called `json-extra` that makes decoding large objects easier.

   Remember Luke Skywalker from last time? Here he is again, along with a type alias for him.

   LEARN: optional fields with `maybe`

   It is pretty common to encounter JSON with optional fields, where sometimes they are present and somtimes they aren't. A natural way to model that in Elm is with a `Maybe`.

   Elm has a `maybe` decoder that helps us with this as well: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.5/Json-Decode#maybe

   Not all star wars characters have eye_color.

   DEMO: change eyeColor to be `Maybe String` in the alias, and change the decoder to handle that

   Sometimes you don't want to make something a `Maybe`, but just want to make it have a default value.

   We can do that in Elm with a combination of stuff we already know, and something new called `oneOf` (http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.5/Json-Decode#oneOf)

   LEARN: decoders and HTTP

   So far all of the HTTP requests we've done have been with Strings, which isn't very helpful for the real world.

   Let's show how to use a decoder with Http.get to get back values. To do that we need a tiny Elm Architecture application.

{-
   LEARN: How to POST data to the server using Json.Encode

   We've seen how to decode incoming JSON, but we also need to transform Elm data in to something that we can send *out* over the wire.

   Look at the function signature for Http.post: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/latest/Http#post

-}
--
-- post : Decoder value -> String -> Http.Body -> Task Http.Error value
-- post _ _ _ =
--     Debug.crash "..."
{-

   It takes a decoder for the result, just like get, a String for the URL, and Body, which is new.
   Check out the type for Body: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/latest/Http#Body

   Just below it we see a function, `Http.string`, that turns a `String` in to a `Body`, along with a horrible-looking example of using it:
-}


coolestHats : Task Http.Error (List String)
coolestHats =
    Http.post
        (list string)
        "http://example.com/hats"
        (Http.string """{ "sortBy": "coolness", "take": 10 }""")



{-


   So somehow we need to turn our Elm object in to a `String`, and then turn that `String` in to a body with `Http.string`.

   For that, we can use Json.Encode! (http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Json-Encode)

   Let's say we want to post a HighScore object to a server.

   We can use Json.Encode to turn this data in to a `String`, like so:

-}


type Weapon
    = RustySpoon
    | MolderingPillow
    | MoistTissue


type alias HighScore =
    { name : String
    , points : Int
    , favoriteWeapon : Weapon
    , time : Float
    }


encodeHighScore : HighScore -> Encode.Value
encodeHighScore { name, points, favoriteWeapon, time } =
    -- live code
    Encode.object
        [ ( "name", Encode.string name )
        , ( "points", Encode.int points )
        , ( "favorite_weapon", Encode.string (toString favoriteWeapon) )
        , ( "time", Encode.float time )
        ]


parseWeapon : String -> Weapon
parseWeapon weapon =
    case weapon of
        "Rusty Spoon" ->
            RustySpoon

        "Moldering Pillow" ->
            MolderingPillow

        "Moist Tissue" ->
            MoistTissue

        _ ->
            RustySpoon


highScore : Decoder HighScore
highScore =
    succeed HighScore
        |: ("name" := string)
        |: ("points" := int)
        |: ("favorite_weapon" := Json.Decode.map parseWeapon string)
        |: ("time" := float)



{-
   The basic principle is you turn any Elm types you want to encode in to JSON values with a function from Json.Encode, and then compose those values together in to objects or arrays with `Encode.object` or `Encode.list`.

   We still need a few more steps to turn our high score in to something we can hand to `Http.post`:

-}


postHighScore : String -> HighScore -> Task Http.Error HighScore
postHighScore url aHighScore =
    -- live code
    Http.post highScore url (aHighScore |> encodeHighScore |> Encode.encode 2 |> Http.string)


post : Decoder value -> String -> Http.Body -> Task Http.Error value
post decoder url body =
    Http.post decoder url body


postLukeUrl =
    "http://httpbin.org/post"


doPostLuke : Maybe Person -> Cmd Msg
doPostLuke maybeLuke =
    case maybeLuke of
        Just luke ->
            Task.perform (always RequestError) GotResponse <|
                Http.post response
                    postLukeUrl
                    (luke
                        |> encodePerson
                        |> Encode.encode 0
                        |> Http.string
                    )

        _ ->
            Cmd.none



-- response : Decoder Data


response : Decoder Person
response =
    -- Json.Decode.object2 Data
    ("json" := person)



-- ("data" := string)
-- type alias Data = { person :Person, data: String}


encodePerson : Person -> Encode.Value
encodePerson person =
    Encode.object
        [ ( "name", Encode.string person.name )
        , ( "height", Encode.string person.height )
        , ( "mass", Encode.string person.mass )
        , ( "hair_color", Encode.string person.hairColor )
        , ( "skin_color", Encode.string person.skinColor )
        , ( "eye_color", Encode.string person.eyeColor )
        , ( "birth_year", Encode.string person.birthYear )
